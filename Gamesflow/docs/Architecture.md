# GamesFlow Emulator - Giant Architecture Documentation

---

## Introduction

**GamesFlow Emulator** is a universal, modular, and extensible emulator framework designed to support the emulation of diverse systems—from vintage consoles to modern handhelds and arcade platforms—across Windows (down to Windows 8), macOS, Linux, and mobile platforms. The project is written primarily in C#, with auxiliary scripting and tools in PowerShell, FLUX, and Perl, aimed at providing unmatched compatibility, portability, and developer experience.

## System Overview

GamesFlow is architected as a “system-of-systems” where the core orchestrates a dynamic ecosystem of device modules, frontends, plugins, and tools. Every major function is designed as an independent component with clear interfaces, allowing for rapid addition of new systems, features, or platforms.

## Core Principles

- **SOLID & Clean Architecture:** Strict separation between domain, infrastructure, and presentation.
- **Service-Oriented:** All modules communicate via service contracts and event buses.
- **Loose Coupling:** Modules reference only necessary abstractions.
- **Testability:** Each component is independently testable; supports CI/CD pipelines.
- **Observability:** Rich logging, metrics, and tracing throughout.
- **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** All user-facing UIs and tools support accessibility features.

---

## Detailed Component Architecture

### Core System

- **Emulator Orchestrator:** Manages the emulation lifecycle and device registration.
- **Configuration:** Handles user/system settings, profiles, dynamic config reloads.
- **Service Registry:** Dependency injection, service locator patterns.
- **State Management:** Save/load, snapshots, fast-backup/restore.
- **Event Bus:** Decoupled communication for device events, plugin messages, and UI updates.
- **Logging & Telemetry:** Structured logging, diagnostics, and analytics.

### Device & Subsystem Modules

Each hardware aspect is a sub-module, supporting multiple implementations.  
**CPU, GPU, Audio, Memory, Input, Network, Peripherals, Storage**—each with:
- Pluggable architecture (swap in new emulated chips or hardware revisions)
- Cross-module messaging via the core event bus
- Optional hardware-accelerated or software-only fallback
- Device-specific configuration and hot-plug/unplug support

### Frontend Platforms

- **Console:** Scripting, automation, headless operation.
- **GUI:** Multi-platform (WPF, Avalonia, GTK, Qt), theming, overlays, full accessibility.

- **Extension Points:** Video, audio, input, netplay, achievements, localization, accessibility.
- **Sandboxing:** Isolated plugin contexts, permissioned APIs.

## Data & Execution Flow

### System Boot Process

1. **Startup**
    - Load configuration, detect hardware, initialize logging.
    - Discover devices, frontends, plugins.
2. **Module Registration**
    - Each device registers with the core, providing capabilities and configuration.
3. **Plugin Loading**
    - Plugins dynamically loaded, registered with extension points.

### Main Emulation Loop

1. **Input Polling**
    - Gather events from input devices, network, UI.
2. **Cycle Execution**
    - CPU cycles, GPU scanlines/frames, Audio ticks, etc.
3. **Memory & State Sync**
    - Devices exchange data via shared memory and event bus.
4. **Plugin Processing**
    - Plugins may intercept or modify execution/data.
5. **Output Generation**
    - Render audio/video, update UI, log, telemetry.

### Frontend–Backend Interaction

- **Command Bus:** Frontends issue commands to core (load ROM, pause, save state, etc.).
- **Event Bus:** Core broadcasts state changes, errors, updates to frontends.
- **Shared Memory:** For high-speed data (e.g., video frames) between core and GUI.

---

## Platform Adaptation

- **Platform Detection:** On startup, detect OS, hardware, input/output capabilities.
- **Device Selection:** Load platform-appropriate device implementations (e.g., DirectX vs Metal vs Vulkan).
- **UI/UX Adaptation:** Switch between desktop, mobile, VR interfaces.
- **Cloud Features:** Enable/disable cloud sync, multiplayer, telemetry based on platform.

---

## Performance, Profiling & Optimization

- **JIT/AOT Compilation:** For CPU-heavy emulation, supports dynamic recompilation.
- **Multi-threading:** Parallel processing for CPU, graphics, audio, and I/O.
- **Hardware Acceleration:** GPU rendering for video, SIMD for math-heavy routines.
- **Profiling Tools:** Built-in profiler, flame graph export, performance counters.
- **Dynamic Throttling:** Auto-adjust frame rates and resource usage based on device capabilities.

---

## Security, Sandboxing & Integrity

- **Plugin Sandboxing:** Plugins run in isolated contexts, with fine-grained permissions.
- **Safe Scripting:** Only whitelisted APIs exposed to scripting plugins.
- **ROM/Asset Validation:** Hashing and database checks to prevent tampering.
- **Crash Reporting:** Automatic, privacy-respecting crash logs and telemetry (opt-in).
- **No Default Networking:** Network features are opt-in and encrypted.

---

## Build, CI/CD & Release Pipeline

- **Automated Builds:** On every commit, PR, and release tag for all major OSes.
- **Test Automation:** Unit, integration, and regression tests run on every build.
- **Artifact Generation:** Pre-built binaries, installer packages, Docker images.
- **Release Publishing:** Automated changelogs, update notifications, and release notes.
- **Code Quality:** Linting, formatting, dependency scanning, security checks.
