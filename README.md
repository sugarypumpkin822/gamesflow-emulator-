# 🎮 All-Systems Emulator Pack

**All-Systems Emulator Pack** is a cross-platform C#-based emulator development suite designed to unify support for hundreds of consoles, handhelds, arcade boards, and computer systems into one modular, extensible toolkit. Built with Visual Studio in mind, it includes emulator stubs, runtime environments, and development tools for .NET 8+ and Mono.

> 🚀 This project structure mimics enterprise-scale emulator development and is fully expandable.

## 🧱 Emulator Cores

Each core is designed with a plug-and-play architecture. New systems can be added by creating a new folder in `Emulators/` and implementing:

- `SystemCore.cs`
- `CPU.cs`
- `PPU.cs`
- `APU.cs`
- `MemoryBus.cs`
- `Controller.cs`

Example:
```csharp
public class NESCore : IEmulatorCore {
    public CPU6502 cpu;
    public PPU ppu;
    public APU apu;

    public void LoadROM(string path) {
        // Load .nes ROM
    }

    public void Step() {
        cpu.ExecuteCycle();
        ppu.RenderScanline();
        apu.GenerateSample();
    }
}
🧰 Tools Included
